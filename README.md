Boots Bootique
=================

Customized implementation of the "Boots Bootique" from the Codecademy course "Create REST APIs with Spring and Java Skill Path".

### Description:
One-page web application that simulates a rudimentary web store. The boots are stored in an H2 database and the frontend is created using Thymeleaf.

###Features:
The user sees a predefined quantity of boots. Each boot is defined by 'type', 'material', 'size' and 'quantity'.
Each existing boot can be deleted or the stock can be reduced or increased using a button next to the entry.
Specific boots can be searched for by any combination of the search parameters 'material', 'type' and 'size'.
